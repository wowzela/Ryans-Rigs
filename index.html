	    <h2>What We Do</h2>

	    <p>We have been building computer rigs for ourselves for the past few years. After speaking to 
		some close friends we learned that they have been wanting a computer too. The only problem was 
		that they did not know how to build their own computer, and everyone else was charging too much
		to build it for them. So we decided to put our hobby to work.</p>
